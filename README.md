# Sample TypeScript Server

This is a simple server written in TypeScript that uses express as its web framework.

The goal of this project is to provide a sample project for those who wish to start a new REST service using typescript.

This is NOT a production-ready system. Many functionalities are not present, like logging, usage of an IoC framework,
real database integration or OpenAPI file.
